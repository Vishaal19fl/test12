                Dei Ritesh, Just read till the end. i noticed many of the good films in hollywood are actually an adaptation of real life stories. So, i have decided to develop this script with real life events. For this script, we are going to see about the theft network called "Pink Panthers"

              <h3>Can you please elaborate for me Vishaal?</h3>
              <p>
                Ok i will elaborate. The Pink Panthers are responsible for what have been
                termed some of the most "glamorous" heists in history, with one criminologist
                even describing their crimes as "artistry".[1] They have operated in numerous
                countries and on several continents, and include Japan's most successful
                robbery amongst their thefts. A film documentary based upon their thefts,
                Smash & Grab, was released on 2 July 2013.[6] Some law enforcement
                agencies[which?] suspect that the group is responsible for over US$500 million
                in robberies of gold and diamonds from the United Arab Emirates, Switzerland,
                Japan, France, Liechtenstein, Germany, United States of America, Luxembourg,
                Cyprus, Spain, Monaco, Austria and Australia, as well as the Netherlands,
                Portugal and Belgium. Law enforcement authorities suspect their involvement in
                the heist of the jewellery store Harry Winston in Paris on 9 December 2008.
                The thieves escaped with more than €80 million worth of jewellery.[7]
              </p>
              <h3>Can you list some of their robberies Vishaal?</h3>
              <p>Yes. In 2003, the gang first came to attention and earned the nickname "Pink
                Panthers" following the theft of a £500,000 diamond from a jewellers in the
                Mayfair area of London.[1] The thieves hid the diamond in a jar of face cream,
                mimicking an act seen in the film The Return of the Pink Panther.[1] In May
                2005, Graff, a diamond specialist in London, was targeted by Pink Panthers and
                lost a total of £1 million in jewellery.[8] Three men were suspected of being
                behind the theft; one was in possession of a firearm.[8] Graff had been targeted
                in 2002 and lost £23 million on that occasion, £3 million of which was recovered
                two years later.[8][9] One of the thieves was sentenced to 15 years in prison in
                July 2004.[9] 
              </p>
              <p>In the space of six years during the 21st century, the Pink
                Panthers robbed 120 stores in 20 different countries.[10] Japan, London,
                Denmark, Monaco, Paris, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and the United
                States have all been targeted by the gang,[1][10] with the attention to detail
                of the heists ensuring a high rate of success. Before robbing a jewellery store
                in Biarritz, the gang covered a nearby bench in fresh paint to deter anyone from
                sitting on it and seeing them in action.</p>

                

                <h2>More info: </h2>
                <p>The gang is suspected of participating in at least two smash-and-grab jewellery
                    robberies in Tokyo's Ginza district. The first, in 2004, netted ¥3.5 million in
                    gems. The second, in June 2007, took jewellery valued at ¥284 million; during
                    the heist, Rifat Hadžiahmetović and Radovan Jelušić sprayed tear gas at three
                    saleswomen before taking a tiara, necklaces, and other jewels and fleeing the
                    store.</p>
                <p>
                    
                    The gang is also known for its escapes and its attempts to break into
                    their chosen store. The gang robbed a jewellery store in Saint-Tropez in 2005
                    wearing T-shirts emblazoned with flowery designs, before making their escape on
                    a speedboat.[1] Prior to one 2008 robbery of Graff jewellers in Dubai, eight
                    gang members drove a pair of Audis through a window, taking watches and other
                    items worth a total of £8 million.[1] In a further robbery in December 2008,
                    four gang members dressed themselves up as women before breaking into Harry
                    Winston jewellers in Paris.[10] The gang escaped from the store with items worth
                    over US$100 million (£60 million).

                </p>    
                <p>Speculation also exists as to certain
                    other robberies having been conducted by the gang; the August 2009 robbery of
                    Graff Diamonds in London is speculated to have been conducted by the gang, a key
                    element in the speculation being that the robbers made no attempt to hide their
                    faces, suggesting that they had already altered their appearances with
                    prosthetic makeup.</p>
                
                <h3>Can I see any videos of them Vishaal?</h3>
                <p>Yes, you can see them.</p>

                <h3>So what is your idea Vishaal?</h3>
                <p>
                    We are not going to replicate their full story but we are just going to use
                    their tricks and techniques of robbing. I have decided to have a protoganist
                    who is an anti-hero type character, who forms this organisation/network to
                    steal jewels and money. But we need a strong backstory of how he becomes an
                    anti hero and why he forms this network and why he decides to steal. We should
                    also think what he does after forming this network. Lets discuss later whether
                    we need an antagonist or not.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is the outline of the script Ritesh. Do research about this gang and find some useful info that we can use in this film. do something useful atleast once in your life.
